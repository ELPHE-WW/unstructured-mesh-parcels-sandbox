# unstructured-mesh-parcels-sandbox

## Getting started
To work through the notebooks on your own system, we recommend setting up a conda environment and running notebooks within that environment.

To install miniconda on Linux

```
https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

For complete instructions and other distributions, see https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/

Next, create the conda environment and install all necessary packages.


```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate uop_sandbox
```

Start jupyterlab
```
jupyterlab
```
